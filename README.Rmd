# Lab report #1

Follow the instructions posted at https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html for the lab assignment. The work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file to your repository.  

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for grading once the due date is passed.

# My Experience with Chapter 12

This is my experience following the steps from Chapter 12 in *Happy Git and GitHub for the useR*.

### 1. Prerequisites

All prerequisites were set up correctly. I had already created a GitHub account, installed/updated R, RStudio, and Git. I also confirmed that I could push and pull from GitHub via the command line without any issues.

### 2. Make a Repository on GitHub

I was able to create a new GitHub repository without any issues. The repository was named and initialized with a README file, and everything worked smoothly.

### 3. Clone the Test GitHub Repository to Your Computer via RStudio

The cloning process went smoothly. I opened RStudio, went to `File > New Project > Version Control > Git`, pasted the repository URL, and created the project without any issues.

### 4. Make Local Changes, Save, and Commit

I modified the `README.md` file in RStudio by adding a new line, saved the file, and committed the changes. The process of staging, committing, and writing a commit message went smoothly.

### 5. Push Your Local Changes Online to GitHub

The push operation worked without any challenges. Authentication was smooth, and I was able to push my local changes to the remote GitHub repository without any issues.

### 6. Confirm the Local Change Propagated to the GitHub Remote

I refreshed the GitHub repository in my browser and confirmed that my changes appeared online as expected. The changes were reflected in the `README.md` file, and the commit history showed the correct message.
